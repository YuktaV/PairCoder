# PairCoder Development Continuity

This document tracks the ongoing development of PairCoder to maintain continuity between development sessions.

## Current Status

### Completed Features

- **Project Initialization**: Basic project setup and configuration
- **Module Management**: Adding, listing, and removing modules
- **Focus Management**: Setting focus on specific modules
- **Context Generation**: Generating context at different detail levels
- **Export Command**: Generating and exporting optimized contexts with token statistics
- **Enhanced Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive test suite with integration, snapshot, and visual reporting

### In Progress

- **Token Optimization System**: Implementing strategies for optimizing token usage
  - Core TokenOptimizer class ✓
  - Individual optimization strategies ✓
  - Helper utility functions ✓
  - Integration with context generator ✓
  - CLI export command integration ✓

### Dependencies and Compatibility

The project uses CommonJS module format and requires specific versions of packages:
- chalk@4.1.2 (not v5+, which is ESM-only)
- inquirer@8.2.5 (not v9+, which is ESM-only)
- ora@5.4.1 (newer versions are ESM-only)
- clipboardy@2.3.0 (newer versions are ESM-only)

### Next Steps

- **Performance Optimization**: Identify and resolve bottlenecks
- **UI/UX Improvements**: Enhance user feedback and experience
- **Advanced Context Features**: Implement more sophisticated context generation
- **Expand Test Coverage**: Add more test cases and improve existing tests

## Integration Points

The export command integrates with the token optimization system to reduce context size while preserving the most important information. The optimization system applies various strategies:

- trimComments: Removes or shortens comments
- reduceIndentation: Reduces unnecessary whitespace
- removeBlankLines: Consolidates empty lines
- summarizeFiles: Replaces large files with summaries
- shortenPaths: Abbreviates long file paths
- codeSkeletonization: Keeps structure but removes implementation details

## Architectural Decisions

1. **Modular Command Structure**: Each CLI command is in its own module
2. **Strategy Pattern for Optimization**: Different optimization strategies can be applied selectively
3. **Progressive Detail Levels**: Context generation supports different detail levels (high, medium, low)
4. **Format Options**: Export supports multiple formats (markdown, text, JSON)

## Known Issues

1. **ESM Compatibility**: Project uses CommonJS but many dependencies have moved to ESM-only in newer versions
2. **Module Name Conflicts**: Need to avoid variable names that conflict with Node.js globals (e.g., 'module')

## Next Development Session

Key tasks for the next development session:
1. Implement remaining CLI commands
2. Add more optimization strategies
3. Improve token estimation accuracy
4. Enhance documentation

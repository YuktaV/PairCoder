# PairCoder - Project Plan

## Project Vision

PairCoder will revolutionize how developers work with AI assistants by solving the core context management problems that currently limit the effectiveness of these collaborations. It will provide a seamless way to feed the right context to Claude at the right time, without wasting tokens or developer effort.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (MVP)

**Duration: 2-3 weeks**

- Basic CLI with essential commands (init, module, generate, focus)
- Project structure scanning and basic summarization
- Module boundary definition
- Simple version snapshots
- Basic exclude functionality (node_modules, etc.)
- Configuration file management (.pcconfig.json)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Context Management

**Duration: 2-3 weeks**

- Multi-level code summarization (high/medium/low detail)
- Automatic tech stack detection
- Dependency mapping between modules
- Change tracking and diff generation
- Token budget management
- Context compression algorithms

### Phase 3: Workflow Optimization

**Duration: 2-3 weeks**

- Template-based communication (issue reporting, etc.)
- Conversation journaling
- Architecture visualization
- Git integration
- Milestone tracking
- Development stage awareness

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Optimization

**Duration: 3-4 weeks**

- Code embeddings for semantic search
- Custom tagging system
- Automatic prompt generation
- Framework-specific templates
- Performance optimization
- User experience improvements

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **CLI Interface**: Command parsing and user interaction
2. **Project Scanner**: Analyzes project structure and tech stack
3. **Module Manager**: Handles module boundaries and focus
4. **Context Generator**: Creates summaries and representations
5. **Version Controller**: Manages snapshots and history
6. **Storage Manager**: Handles local storage of metadata
7. **Prompt Engine**: Generates optimized prompts for Claude
8. **Integration Layer**: Connects with external tools (Git, etc.)

### Data Flow

1. User initializes PairCoder in a project
2. Tool scans the project structure and creates initial metadata
3. User defines module boundaries or accepts detected ones
4. Tool generates context at various detail levels
5. User focuses on specific modules as needed
6. Tool provides relevant context to paste into Claude
7. Changes are tracked and context is updated incrementally

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: Node.js (for cross-platform compatibility)
- **Storage**: Local file-based (.pc directory) with optional cloud sync
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Commander.js (CLI framework)
  - Chalk (terminal styling)
  - Axios (for any API integrations)
  - Simple-git (for Git integration)
  - Inquirer (for interactive prompts)
  - Chokidar (for file watching)

## Success Metrics

- Reduction in token usage for similar tasks
- Faster context switching between project modules
- Improved clarity in developer-AI communication
- Reduced repetition in conversations
- Increased productivity in AI-assisted development

## Risk Factors

- Keeping summaries accurate and up-to-date
- Balancing detail vs. token efficiency
- Managing large projects effectively
- Ensuring security of potentially sensitive code
- Compatibility across different project structures

# Test Improvement Progress

## Completed Work

### Command Refactoring with Dependency Injection

We've successfully applied the dependency injection pattern to several key CLI commands:

1. **config.js** - Refactored to use the factory pattern, with 100% code coverage
2. **prompt.js** - Implemented with improved tests (86.03% coverage)
3. **module.js** - Implemented with improved tests (97.16% coverage)

### Implementation Approach

Our approach was to:

1. Create a factory function that accepts dependencies
2. Move the original command implementation to this factory
3. Use default dependencies when none are provided
4. Create a thin wrapper that uses the factory with default dependencies
5. Write tests that inject mock dependencies for complete control

### Documentation

We've also updated the testing best practices documentation with:

1. Details about our dependency injection approach
2. A new section on the Command Factory Pattern 
3. Examples of how to use the pattern in test code
4. Updated information about our current test coverage

## Next Steps

To continue improving test coverage:

1. **Apply the same pattern to remaining commands**:
   - export.js
   - focus.js
   - generate.js
   - init.js
   - scan.js
   - exclude.js

2. **Fix obsolete snapshots**:
   - Run `npx jest -u` to update the 6 obsolete snapshot files

3. **Create integration tests**:
   - Test interactions between multiple commands
   - Ensure the refactored commands work together correctly

4. **Address global coverage thresholds**:
   - Current global coverage is around 17.95% for statements
   - Target is 60% for statements and lines
   - Need to prioritize testing high-impact components first

## Benefits Observed

The dependency injection and factory pattern has provided:

1. **Better testability** - We can easily mock dependencies
2. **Improved coverage** - It's easier to test edge cases and error conditions
3. **Cleaner implementation** - Clear separation of concerns
4. **More consistent code** - Standardized pattern across commands
5. **Maintainability** - Easier to modify and extend functionality

## Potential Challenges

Some potential challenges to be aware of:

1. **Test maintenance** - More comprehensive tests require more maintenance
2. **Complex mocking** - Some dependencies might be harder to mock effectively
3. **Edge cases** - Ensuring all error paths are covered
4. **Integration testing** - Making sure components work together correctly

## Overall Assessment

The dependency injection pattern has proven very effective for improving test coverage and code quality. We should continue this approach across all CLI commands to achieve the coverage targets and improve overall code quality.
